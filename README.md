# MyPrivate Blockchain Project
That's my first private blockchain in action. All methods are Promise based. Enjoy it!


## TL;DR
To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the chain and related tests with `npm start`

## What You're Getting
```bash
├── README.md - # This file.
├── package.json # npm package manager file
├── index.js # a script with api invoke for test and chain initialization
├── levelSandbox.js # wrapper over LevelDB api
└── simpleChain.js # that's the core containing chain logic

```
